  <h1> My Expertise </h1>
  <!-- <p> {{site.user_description}} </p> -->
  <p> I am a 
    <b> data scientist </b> 
    with 
    <b> more than five years of background in public speaking and communications. </b> 
    <br>
    <br>
    Currently, I'm completing my 
    <b> B.S. in Data Science @ UCSD </b> 
    (University of California, San Diego), and I'll soon pursue my (part-time)<b> M.S. in Computer Science @ UCSD.</b>
  </p>
  <p> 
    I'm invested in work on the level of 
    <b>human-to-human interaction â€” project management, consulting, time at the podium</b>; 
    it's in my blood as a <b>tutor</b>
    , as a <b> professional events organizer</b>, 
    as an <b>orator</b>. 
    <br>
    <br>
    I also view myself as someone who <b>makes technology and processes more explainable.</b> 
    <br>
    <br>
    When I'm not at my computer, I'm often discussing with my parents how to live authentically, training flexibility for future breakdancing, and filling sticky notes with musical ideas for the saxophone at my bedside.
