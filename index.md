# Hi! I'm Nick Swetlin, a **Data Scientist** with an extensive background in **Public Speaking and Communications.**

Currently, I'm completing my **B.S. in Data Science @ UCSD** (University of California, San Diego); and I'll soon pursue my (part-time) **M.S. in Computer Science @ UCSD**!

I'm invested in work on the level of **human interaction -- meetings, consulting, services**; it's in my blood as a **tutor**, as a **professional events organizer**, as an **orator**. If we can help individual people meet their needs in a way that involves **tech and data**? I'm there.

In the past that's looked like:
- Preparing students for the future with **coding interview prep workshops.**
- Generating **blackout data analyses** to inform power outage frequency.
- Authoring "The Sounds You Make", an **interactive linguistics web article**.
- Animating **mathematics @ 60 FPS** for my data science cohort.
- Gamifying a six-month research capstone on Neural Network Test-Time Adaptation to **pitch to an audience of 50+ students and industry professionals**.
- Visualizing "Feeding San Diego" (a food insecurity NGO) **volunteerism data** to better understand my area.
- Speaking at the **podium for 5+ years** to change minds as a debater, high school musician panelist, tutor, and professional events host.

... but there's obviously much more to the story than that.
